# Hexconverter

## Usage

This addon instantly converts numbers from and to different formats : decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal and base 256.

If the hexadecimal value corresponds to a color, the corresponding color is displayed in RGB decimal format, and an indicator displays a preview of the color. If it corresponds to a HTML color, its name is displayed.

It is possible to display the converter in a separate window to avoid losing converted data.
